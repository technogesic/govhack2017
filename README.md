GovHack 2017 Repository for Team Technogesic

## The Sounds of Then (This is Australia)
This project was created for [2017 GovHack](http://govhack.org/) and utilises open Austrlaian Government data from the ABS 2016 Census, NSW & VIC GTFS transit data and Ballarat City Council.

Work in this project is borrowed from the DataDrivenDJ, Brian Foo, in particular his [Two Trains](https://datadrivendj.com/tracks/subway) piece.

Examples of the output of this project are available on the [project website](https://govhack2017.technogesic.com).
